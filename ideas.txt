To add more fun and functionality to your prank app, you can consider the following ideas:

1. Prank Categories: Organize prank templates into different categories such as funny pranks, scary pranks, or office pranks. Allow users to browse and select pranks from specific categories.

2. Prank Scheduler: Implement a feature that allows users to schedule pranks for specific dates and times. This can add an element of surprise and anticipation to the pranks.

3. Prank Sharing: Enable users to share their favorite pranks with others through social media or messaging platforms. This can encourage user engagement and viral sharing of pranks.

4. Prank History and Statistics: Keep track of the pranks executed by each user and provide statistics such as the most popular prank, the most active user, or the success rate of pranks.

5. User Accounts: Implement user account functionality to allow users to save their favorite pranks, track their prank history, and customize their prank settings.

6. Prank Ideas Generator: Provide a feature that generates random prank ideas or suggestions for users who need inspiration.

Remember to always consider the ethical implications of pranks and ensure that they are harmless and consensual.
