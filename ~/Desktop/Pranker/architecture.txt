Pranker App Architecture

The Pranker app follows a client-server architecture. The client-side of the app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the server-side is implemented using Node.js and Express.js.

The app uses a RESTful API to communicate between the client and server. The client sends HTTP requests to the server to perform various actions, such as creating pranks, retrieving pranks, and updating pranks.

The server processes these requests and interacts with a database to store and retrieve prank data. The app uses MongoDB as the database to store prank information.

Overall, the Pranker App app is designed to provide a fun and interactive platform for users to create and share pranks with others.
