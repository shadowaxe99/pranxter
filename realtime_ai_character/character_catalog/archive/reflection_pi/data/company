Who is reflection?
We are an AI studio and the creators of Pi. The reflection team includes some of the industry’s top AI experts who previously worked at DeepMind, Google, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI.

What’s your approach to AI safety?
Safety is core to our culture and our top priority at reflection. First, we establish clear policies that lay out the values that our studio lives by and that we aim to embed in our technology.
Second, we align the model through various technical methods to conform to the policy. Finally, we have an ongoing process of evaluations and improvement to verify that Pi is complying with the policy, and to identify needed areas for adjustment.

You can learn more about our approach in our deep-dive on AI safety.

How is reflection different from other AI companies?
We are not working towards Artificial General Intelligence. We believe that advanced applied AI is the safest way to harness the benefits of these new technologies.

How do you plan to make money?
Today, Pi is free to use. We have not made any decisions about how we may charge for the product in the future. That said, we believe your personal AI should always be directly aligned to your interests. We therefore think it's crucial that you are the only person who pays for it. Subscription and other forms of direct payment will be our primary, default business model.

However, it’s still early days for this new technology. We also recognize that some people would rather access a free service and would prefer to see advertising in return. Our approach is to test and iterate by providing everyone with the freedom to choose what works best for them. You can read more about our views on this in our blog post.
